# Simulating_a_hippocampus_microcircuit
This is a course offered by EPFL through edx which studies and simulates a hippocampus microcircuit in python. This study is intended to reinforce my understanding of the brain, to simulate a circuit in python, and continue my journey to work on BCI technology at companies such as Neuralink.
